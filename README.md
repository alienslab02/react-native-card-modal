# react-native-card-modal
A pure javascript card modal for React Native framework.

##Disclaimer
Thank you guys for all the love! Just pointing out--this was my first animation project, and it's probably not most suitable for production. Once I get more comfortable with Animated library and understand how to optimize the code better, I will refactor the code and publish a library for use ...or maybe somebody can contribute and actually create this into a library.
